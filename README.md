Older Leaflet script: http://83.83.222.154/amsterdam/index2.html

The older Leaflet script (leaflet-src.js) has no lines between tiles. The newer one does. This done on purpose...

When scrolling with the older the delta zoom = 2 meaning you scrol 2 levels up or down.

Can somebody adapt (both) scripts in such a way, that the zoomlevel delta is only one, or even lesser, like in steps from zoom level 16 to 16.1 16.2 16.3 etc.

??
